  <h1>Project Title</h1>
  <p>On this page, and in the code you find examples for</p>
  <ul>
    <li>multi pages linked to each other</li>
    <li>pretty URLs because every page has its own folder</li>
    <li>pseudo class to creat a hover effect on the link</li>
    <li>linking to new pages via canvas interaction</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- the following div will contain the p5 canvas. -->
  <div id="canvasContainer"></div>

  <p>Press below link (or press on the canvas!) to go to the garden.</p>
  <!-- the garden page is inside a folder "garden", inside there
  the html file has the default name "index.html". that's default which
  is why i don't have to link to "garden/index.html" but the browser
  will open that file by default. that also makes the URL look prettier! -->
  <a class="gardenLINK" href="garden">GARDEN</a>
